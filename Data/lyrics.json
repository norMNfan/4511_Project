She's ready to have your baby\nThe type of female the fellas stress\nStay fresh to death, well dressed\nIn Chanel, Guess, nothing less\nBody got more curves than an S\nI smoke her boots like Sess\nAnd I confess the sex was the best (yes)\nWithin a week she had keys to my res\nAnd then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest\nThen one day I overheard her talking to friends\nSaying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends\nYo honey was sheisty\nHad me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous\nGiven her dues that was icey\nI said it's over\nAnd what I gave you, you can have that\nIt wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at\nLetting that dame use me for my name and my fame\nThat's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game\n\nA year ago I did a show for some dough\nPuffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low\nAnd on my way out, it was a female on my trail\nWho followed me from the stage to the Benz SL\nI asked honey her name, she replied, \"Monique\"\nSoft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat\nJump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin' to eat\nShe said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin' to meet\nI tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak\nYeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week\nThen one night to my crib she decided to creep\nKnocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep\nI let her in before you know it we was doin' our thang\nI drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring\nIt was about a month later when she gave me a call\nWith some bogus ass story that was off the wall\nClaimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul\nHow is that? I wore a Lifestyle\n\nSo watch out fellas... Watch out\nYou better watch out fellas\nYeah, you better watch out\nWatch out fellas... You better watch out\nF'real"

'\nI estimated about, 45 maybe 50 g's\nMy man was hungry so I dropped him off at mickey d's\nNow I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome\nSpotted some niggaz trailin so I picked up the phone\nCalled bones, I said, 'yo son, I'm on the run\nNeed your help before I get done\nMeet me downstairs, bring your big gun'\nI don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it\nCause some bitch is in his house butt-naked\nAnd then he hung up\nAnd this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck\nThat duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?\nI'm cruisin fast and they still behind me\nThe same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey\nIt's about to get, real hasty\nGrabbed the steel, took it off safety\n'Cause I refuse to let these niggaz waste me\nI started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash\nAnd now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass\nAnd one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash\nI was injured too, leakin with a deep gash\nI ain't panicked, I was quite calm\n\n\nCouldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left\nWalked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat\nLooked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat\nIt's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep\nI think I'm dyin', I'm feelin' weak out on my feet\nBut before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first\nTo one-forty-first and bradhurst\nThat's where bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin\nLookin' tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down\nFrom the look in my eye, he knew he would die\nStarted to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, 'why? '\nThen he offered me, all of his cheese\nThen dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze\nThen his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out\nInto the streets covered with blood, about to pass out\nThe hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but\nDamn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out\nAnd started blowin' they started blowin' back I'm goin' all out\nI ain't holdin' back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin' back\nI kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top\nThe other pig ducked behind a big truck\nI was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it\nBut still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets\nThe coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near\nSeen kids playin' everywhere then threw the cash in the air\nI watched all of them, run for they share\nAnd all I can do was stare\nI got weak and fell on my rear\nNow I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the jakes\nBut it's too late, I'm knockin' on the pearly gates\n\nYeah, casualties of a dice game\nNever gamble with snakes\nLet that be a lesson to ya\nYeah, it's corleone y'all\nYeah, it's flamboyant y'all\nBig l y'all, flamboyant baby, yeah\nBig l... uh\nBig l... yeah, it's flamboyant y'all, yeah"

Where he rest at?\nWhere he shop at and dress at?\nKnow he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?\nDoes he really know how ill that he is?\nGot all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels\nHop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that\nIt's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains\nLook at my tennis shoes, I iced that\nWho am I?
