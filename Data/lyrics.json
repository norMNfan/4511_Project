I stand alone , Big L Cornleone got song . Sellin weight outta state generate cake . The one jakes hate . Got homicide runnin ' yellow tape . I pack toast infra red scopes , I turn crews dead folks .

' It seems like life 's cursed Ever since I child , I make ? I wo n't , 's I walk around frown ; I got reason smile And I make ? I wo n't , 's Aiiyyo times rough , I grow foul And I make ? I wo n't , 's I always knew I 'd end time Isle And I make ? I wo n't , 's Five years passed , I 'm age 15 No fun games , 's time get cream ( word ) 'Cause I 'm burst , 's like life cursed I went church , prayed everyday And still got worse Soon I ran couple guns Started stalking streets , slate robbing suckers funds ( give , give ) Now everyday I creep heat Ai n't nothing sweet , I rob meat If I n't steal I n't eat Then I lost control started going far Robbed brother named Umar Then got snatched blue car Where I grew living hell Then I started realize - I 'm better prison cell Now I sleep , I eat Ca n't hit skins , I n't hitting skins I street Aiiyyo I ca n't take And every day I ask , 'how I make ? ' Doing time full stress G , Fighting 's stabbings men finding men sexy One tried test n't find humorous Beat pillowcase filled cans tuna fish My time came cease ; I 'm back streets I hope I n't get snatched beast But 's getting crazy hectic 'Cause I 'm broke , get naked And ca n't get job cause jail record Before know , I robbing ducks I even started robbing homeless folks change cups My whole life deserted Either I'ma go back jail get murdered , I deserve ? All I tried live one life I got But seems like I ca n't get fair shot ( word ) I ca n't take ( uh-huh ) And every day I ask , 'how I make ? ' Word man , 's real rough man In ghetto , wish better tomorrow It ai n't getting better , 's getting worse , word ...",
