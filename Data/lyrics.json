I'm so confused\n&gt;From seein heads shake so many times the lead make\nAnd mike boogies next up, and keep my head straight\n\nMike boogie\nI should never rhyme cause every time I step into a

'\nThen he offered me, all of his cheese\nThen dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze\nThen his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out\nInto the streets covered with blood, about to pass out\nThe hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but\nDamn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out\nAnd started blowin' they started blowin' back I'm goin' all out\nI ain't holdin' back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin' back\nI kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top\nThe other pig ducked behind a big truck\nI was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it\nBut still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets\nThe coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near\nSeen kids playin' everywhere then threw the cash in the air\nI watched all of them, run for they share\nAnd all I can do was stare\nI got weak and fell on my rear\nNow I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the jakes\nBut it's too late, I'm knockin' on the pearly gates\n\nYeah, casualties of a dice game\nNever gamble with snakes\nLet that be a lesson to ya\nYeah, it's corleone y'all\nYeah, it's flamboyant y'all\nBig l y'all, flamboyant baby, yeah\nBig l... uh\nBig l... yeah, it's flamboyant y'all, yeah",
